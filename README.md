## How ğŸ˜€âŒ¨ works ##
ğŸ˜€âŒ¨ works by posting photos to the Google Cloud Vision Api, labelling them, and then converting the
text labels into emojis using emoji-java. Since not all labels can be converted directly to emojis, 
this project also includes a map to convert specific labels. Whenever a label isn't recognized, an 
event is sent to Firebase Analytics so it can be added later.

In order to use ğŸ˜€âŒ¨ to type, start typing anywhere. A keyboard icon will appear in the bottom right of the screen. Press it to see keyboard options and select ğŸ˜€âŒ¨.

Samsung Devices:
